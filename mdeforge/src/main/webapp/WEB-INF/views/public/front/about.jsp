							MDEForge is anextensible Web-based modeling platform specifically conceived to foster a community-based modeling repository, 
							which underpins the development, analysis and reuse of modeling artifacts. 
							Moreover, it enables the adoption of model management tools as software-as-a-service that can be remotely used without overwhelming 
							the users with intricate and error-prone installation and configuration procedures.

									<h4>MDE Forge Platform</h4>
									<p>MDEForge platform consists of a number of services that can be used by means of both a Web access and programmatic interfaces (API) that enable their adoption as software as a service. 
										In particular, core services are provided to enable the management of modeling artifacts, namely transformations, models, metamodels, and editors. Atop of such core services, extensions can be developed to add new functionalities.

											<h4>Developers of modeling artifacts</h4>
											<p>As previously said we envision a community of users that might want to share their tools and enable their adoption and refinement by other users. To this end the platform provides the means to add new modeling artifacts to the MDEForge repository.</p>

											<h4>Developers of MDEForge extensions</h4>
											<p>One of the requirements we identified when we started the development of MDEForge is about the modularity and extensibility of the platform. To this end we identified a set of core services that can be used to add new functionalities by means of platform extensions. In this respect, experienced users might contribute by proposing new extensions to be included in the platform.</p>

											<h4>End-users</h4>
											<p>A Web application enables end-users to search and use (meta)models, transformations, and editors available in the MDEForge repository. Experienced users might use the REST API to exploit the functionalities provided by the platform in a programmatic way. For instance, tool vendors might exploit the functionalities provided by their tools by exploiting some of the transformations available in the MDEForge repository.</p>
