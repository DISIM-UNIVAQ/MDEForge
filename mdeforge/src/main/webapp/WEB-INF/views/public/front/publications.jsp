							        <strong>Abstract. </strong>
							        Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) refers to the systematic use of models
									as first class entities throughout the software development life cycle. Over the
									last few years, many MDE technologies have been conceived for developing domain
									specific modeling languages, and for supporting a wide range of model
									management activities. However, existing modeling platforms neglect a number
									of important features that if missed reduce the acceptance and the relevance of
									MDE in industrial contexts, e.g., the possibility to search and reuse already developed
									modeling artifacts, and to adopt model management tools as a service.
									In this paper we propose MDEForge a novel extensible Web-based modeling platform
									specifically conceived to foster a community-based modeling repository,
									which underpins the development, analysis and reuse of modeling artifacts. Moreover,
									it enables the adoption of model management tools as software-as-a-service
									that can be remotely used without overwhelming the users with intricate and
									error-prone installation and configuration procedures.

							        <strong>Abstract. </strong>
							       Metamodels are a key concept in Model-Driven Engineering.
									Any artifact in a modeling ecosystem has to be defined in accordance to
									a metamodel prescribing its main qualities. One of the most important
									artifact is model transformation that are considered to be the heart and
									soul of MDE and as such advanced techniques and tools are needed for
									supporting the development, quality assurance, maintenance, and evolution
									of model transformations. Several works propose the adoption of
									metrics to measure quality attributes of transformation without considering
									any metamodel aspects. In this paper, we present an approach to
									understand structural characteristics of metamodels and how the model
									transformations depend on corresponding input and target metamodels.

							        <strong>Abstract. </strong>
							      Recently proposed model repositories aim to support specific needs--for example, collaborative modeling, the ability to use different modeling tools in software life-cycle management, tool interoperability, increased model reuse, and the integration of heterogeneous models.

							        <strong>Abstract. </strong>
							     	
							     	In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) the development of complex
									and large transformations can benefit from the reuse of smaller ones that can be
									composed according to user requirements. Composing transformations is a complex
									problem: typically smaller transformations are discovered and selected by
									developers from different and heterogeneous sources. Then the identified transformations
									are chained by means of manual and error-prone composition processes.
									Based on our approach, when we propose one or more transformation
									chains to the user, it is difficult for him to choose one path instead of another
									without considering the semantic properties of a transformation.
									In this paper when multiple chains are proposed to the user, according to his requirements,
									we propose an approach to classify these suitable chains with respect
									to the coverage of the metamodels involved in the transformation. Based on coverage
									value, we are able to qualify the transformation chains with an evaluation
									criteria which gives as an indication of how much information a transformation
									chain covers over another.

							        <strong>Abstract. </strong>
							     	
							     	Model transformations are considered to be the "heart" and "soul" of Model Driven Engineering, and as a such, advanced techniques and tools are needed for supporting the development, quality assurance, maintenance, and evolution of model transformations. Even though model transformation developers are gaining the availability of powerful languages and tools for developing, and testing model transformations, very few techniques are available to support the understanding of transformation characteristics. In this paper, we propose a process to analyze model transformations with the aim of identifying to what extent their characteristics depend on the corresponding input and target metamodels. The process relies on a number of transformation and metamodel metrics that are calculated and properly correlated. The paper discusses the application of the approach on a corpus consisting of more than 90 ATL transformations and 70 corresponding metamodels.
